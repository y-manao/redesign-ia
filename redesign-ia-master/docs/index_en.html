              <p>This year's concept for the 11th edition of the event is "bones". As we build bones and put on flesh, we each discovered that we could build on the foundation we laid in our first and second years I have deepened my knowledge, expression and skills in my field of study. We hope that you will be able to enjoy the many works that can only be experienced at the exhibition, and that you will be able to see what each of them has to offer. I hope you can get a sense of what kind of fleshing out we've done.</p>

              <p>This year's concept is "Quest". We viewed our university studies as an "exploration". The space that follows represents our path, and the light at the end of the path represents the answer to our "quest". Also, if you look around the whole thing, the letter Q, the acronym for "Quest," comes into view. We hope you'll take a look at the culmination of all the work the students have done so far in their search for unseen sights and experiences.</p>
